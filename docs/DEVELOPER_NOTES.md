## Architecture

The proof decentralized exchange is a hybrid decentralized exchange that aims at bringing together the ease of use of 
centralized exchanges along with the security and privacy features of decentralized exchanges. Orders are matched 
through the proof orderbook. After orders are matched, the decentralized exchange operator has the sole ability to 
perform a transaction to the smart contract.This provides for the best UX as the exchange operator is the only party 
having to interact directly with the blockchain. Exchange users simply sign orders which are broadcasted to the 
orderbook.This enables users to cancel their orders without having to perform a blockchain transaction and pay the 
associated gas fees.

## Why 'Allowance' mechanism is used instead of 'Deposit/Withdraw' mechanism in the exchange?

### Deposit/Withdraw

In the deposit/withdraw mechanism, the user is required to deposit the token in the exchange based on which he can carry out
the trade. If the user now wishes to cancel the trade & spend the deposited tokens for some other purpose, He would need to
create 3 transactions:
- "Cancel order" transaction.
- "Withdraw token" transaction.
- "Spend token" transaction.  

which will cause user to bear extra costs. 

### Allowance

In the allowance mechanism, if the user has enough token balance for the trade, he/she would not need to deposit tokens in
exchange but instead just approve the exchange with the amount ot tokens to spend in trade. If the user further wishes to 
cancel the trade & spend the & spend the deposited tokens for some other purpose, He would need to
create 2 transactions: 
- "Cancel order" transaction.
- "Spend token" transaction.  

which eliminates the extra costs of "withdraw token" transaction. The user does not need to reset the allowance as the exchange
can not be misuse it, as the exchange can spend allownce only for signed order by user that are not cancelled.

## Why only Owner/Operator can call 'executeTrade' in the smart contract & settle an order on-chain?

The exchange contract is designed such that only the operator or owner is authorized to submit signed trades to Ethereum.
This enables operator/exchange to control the order in which transactions are processed, separating the act of trading from
final settlement. 

As users trade their In-Order exchange balances are updated in real-time, while simultaneously their private keys are used to 
authorize the trade in the contract. This authorization prevents users from rescinding any completed trades, and prevents
exchange from initiating any unauthorized trades.

Exchange manages the queue of pending transactions, dispatching them in sequence to ensure that each trade is mined in the
correct order and that the smart contract balances stay in sync with the exchange balances. By controlling the transaction 
sequence, Exchange provides the speed and user experience of centralized exchanges combined with the security and 
auditability of decentralized exchanges.

The concept is inspired by IDEX.

##  Why the exchange uses W-ETH & not pure ETH as fees?

Decentralized platforms running on Ethereum use smart contracts to facilitate trades directly between users, every user needs
to have the same standardized format for every token they trade. Which ensures tokens donâ€™t get lost in translation. ETH does 
not confirm to it's own ERC20 standard as it was built before the ERC20 standard existed. Thus by converting ETH to W-ETH 
enables users to trade ETH for other ERC20 tokens on decentralized platforms. 

The current implementation of W-ETH can be found at :
https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#code

When you "wrap" ETH, you aren't really wrapping so much as trading via a smart contract for an equal token called W-ETH. 
If you want to get plain ETH back you need to "unwrap" it. AKA trade it back for plain ETH.

In order to pay fees for orders/trade in exchange they do not need to deposit any ETH in exchange, instead the user should hold 
the W-ETH fees amount & have to provide allowance to exchange just like they do for other tokens they trade, so that exchange 
can transfer the W-ETH fees amount to feesAccount when executing a trade.

Benifits of W-ETH :
- The source code for the proposed W-ETH contract has been thoroughly audited & contracts which have been both audited and held
significant value over a period of time, are considered to be safer.

- The W-ETH contract support for unlimited allowances, which means that user can provide allowance once to exchange & than can
trade as much as needed.

- Simplifies the Exchange contract as the 'executeTrade' does not need to conditionally manage transfer of ERC20 tokens &
ETH, Since ETH is replaced by W-ETH which follows ERC20 standard & can be managed similarly like other ERC20 token.


##  Rounding error check process

When matched orders are exrcuted, the trade amount by taker can be less than the buy token amount defined by maker. In this 
case the order will be partially filled & the partial sell token amount to transfer to maker is calculated using 
'getPartialAmount' function. 'getPartialAmount' involves division process & the actual value could be a fractional. 
Unfortunaltely solidity does not support floating point type yet & hence the value would get floored/rounded out. This floored 
value would be returned by 'getPartialAmount' function. 

In order to prevent the maker from the loss caused due to the flooring of actual value, rounding error check is 
implemented. The 'isRoundingError' functions checks wether the percentage rounding error exceeds 0.1%, if yes then the function returns 'true' else it returns 'false'.

Formula to calculate % error is:
```
% Error = [|(Actual value - Accepted value)|/|Accepted value|] * 100
```

Here, 

Actual value = floor((tradeAmount * sellTokenAmount)/buyTokenAmount)  
Accepted value = (tradeAmount * sellTokenAmount)/buyTokenAmount 

But before we substitute the equatons of 'Actual value' & 'Accepted value', We have : 
```
((a*b/c) - floor(a*b/c)) / (a*b/c) = ((a*b)%c)/(a*b)
```

So the % Error formula above can be simplied to :
```
% Error = [((tradeAmount * sellTokenAmount) % buyTokenAmount) / (tradeAmount * sellTokenAmount)] * 100 
```
where (tradeAmount * sellTokenAmount) % buyTokenAmount = R = the remainder of calculation. This simplifies the equation to :
```
% Error = [R / (tradeAmount * sellTokenAmount)] * 100 
```


Now the 'isRoundingError' functions checks wether the percentage rounding error exceeds 0.1%. So,
```
R / (tradeAmount * sellTokenAmount) * 100 > 0.1
R / (tradeAmount * sellTokenAmount) > 0.001
```

Division in Solidity can only return an integer, so multiplying each side by 1000 yields:
```
1000 * R / (tradeAmount * sellTokenAmount) > 1
```
Integer division is still unable to detect 3 decimal places (for 0.001) so multiply by 1000 again to get 3 decimal places:
```
1,000,000 * R /(tradeAmount * sellTokenAmount) > 1000
```
If the calculation is greater than 1000, this means there's a rounding error greater than 0.001 and the function returns true.
So the final implementaion becomes: 

```
function isRoundingError(uint numerator, uint denominator, uint target)
public
pure
returns (bool)
{
    uint remainder = mulmod(target, numerator, denominator);
    if (remainder == 0) return false;
    // No rounding error.

    uint errPercentageTimes1000000 = (remainder.mul(1000000)).div(numerator.mul(target));
    return errPercentageTimes1000000 > 1000;
}
```

The concept is inspired by 0x.
